Basically we use advanced state management in order to fix problem of managing state in more complex react apps. We can get rid off problems showed below:

--> Problem of shared state : Prop drilling - sharing props through multiple components, even though most of them do not need that data. Components are less reusable, we need to write extra 'boiler plate' code etc...

--> Embracing Component Composition

--> Sharing State with Context

ContextAPI provides us with another react hook which allows us to use Reducer - it is made for sharing data across components and layers.

We create context value and we provide that value around multiple components. Also it can easily be connected to state - so we also can get rid off all those props, passing state, state updating funcions throughout multiple component layers.

In single app we can have multiple context's so we try to avoid wrapping components with '<contextName>.Provider ...'
