Exposing Component APIs
Your working on a part of an application that contains a form which should be resettable from outside that form.

A colleague prepared a Form component that contains a couple of dummy inputs and a "Save" button that's not doing anything.

Your task is to expose a clear() function from inside that Form component so that other components that use the Form component can call that function to reset the form.

Because that exposed clear() function should call the form's built-in reset() method (the JS form object, which is the underlying object of the <form> element, has a reset() method that does exactly what its name implies).

So the Form component should be usable like this:



function SomeComponent() {
  const form = React.useRef();
 
  function handleClear() {
    form.current.clear();
  }
 
  return <Form ref={form}/>
}


After adding this feature to the Form component you should tweak the App component to establish a "connection" to the Form component and call the newly exposed clear() method from inside the App component's handleRestart() function.

So you should add code similar to the above code snippet to the App component.

Important: In this Udemy exercise workspace, any React Hooks (and other React functions!) must be accessed directly on the imported React object (import React from 'react') - for example: React.useState().
