Exercise: Dynamic Styles
Your task is to dynamically apply a style (color: red) to the <p>Style me</p> element in the provided React app.

The style should be applied as an inline style (i.e., via the style attribute / prop) when the <button> is clicked for the first time. Once the button is clicked again, the styling should switch back to color: white, which should also be the initial style.

Make sure that the button toggles between these two styles (color: white <=> color: red).

Here's how the finished app should look like BEFORE the button was clicked:


Here's how it should look like AFTER the button was clicked:


And here's how it should look like when the button was clicked again:


Important: Use React.useState() instead of just useState() as the latter can cause problems in this Udemy code environment.
